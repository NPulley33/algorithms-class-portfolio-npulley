### Data Structure Comparison
- Maps vs. Arrays: a map is an array of buckets that uses a hash or other algorithm to determine where an element would be placed. This makes finding any particular element very fast as you know exactly where to access it. Arrays store items linerally, and to find an element you have to traverse through the array. Maps are useful when you need to worry about space and accessing elements quickly. Arrays are useful when you know you are not going to be doing a lot of resizing and do not need to access elements quickly with a key.
- Stacks vs. Queues: a stack is a first in, last out (FILO) collection. a queue is a first in, first out (FIFO) collection. With both collections, you can only access the "top" or "first" element. Determining which to use is based off of what order you need to access elements in.
